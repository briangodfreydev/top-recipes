    <h1>Sweet Potato Pancakes</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These are a very welcome change from regular pancakes. Great with maple syrup or cranberry sauce.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3/4 pound sweet potatoes</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups milk</li>
        <li>1/4 cup butter, melted</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place sweet potatoes in a medium saucepan of boiling water, and cook until tender but firm, about 15 minutes. Drain, and immediately immerse in cold water to loosen skins. Drain, remove skins, chop, and mash.
        </li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, sift together flour, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg. Mix mashed sweet potatoes, eggs, milk and butter in a separate medium bowl. Blend sweet potato mixture into the flour mixture to form a batter.
        </li>
        <li>Preheat a lightly greased griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter mixture onto the prepared griddle by heaping tablespoonfuls, and cook until golden brown, turning once with a spatula when the surface begins to bubble.
        </li>
    </ol>
